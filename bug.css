The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can sometimes produce unexpected results when combined with units. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```css
.element { width: calc(50% - 10px); }
```

This is because the browser interprets the calculation as `50% - 10px` which will result in different widths. This is because 50% refers to the width of the parent container, and 10px is fixed unit. Subtracting a fixed unit from a percentage unit does not work as expected.

Another common issue is using `calc()` with multiple units without proper spacing.  For instance:

```css
.element { margin: calc(10px+2em); }
```

This will not work as expected. The spaces around the plus sign are crucial. It should be `calc(10px + 2em);`

Also, be aware that using `calc()` within other CSS properties might lead to issues. For example, `calc()` within `transform: translate()` needs to have pixels specified, and not percentages.   

And, in some browsers there can be issues with using nested `calc()` functions.
