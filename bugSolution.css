The solution involves careful consideration of unit usage and spacing within `calc()` expressions. 

Here's how to fix the issues shown in `bug.css`:

**1. Combining Units:**

Instead of subtracting pixels from percentages directly, consider alternative approaches like using variables or intermediate calculations.

```css
:root {
  --element-width: 50%;
  --element-margin: 10px;
}

.element {
  width: calc(var(--element-width) - var(--element-margin));
}
```

This provides better clarity and maintainability, allowing for easier adjustments.  Or if you want a percentage based calculation do the following:

```css
.element {
  width: 50%;
  margin-left: 2%;
  margin-right: 2%;
}
```

**2. Spacing in Calculations:**

Always ensure that spaces are present around operators (e.g., +, -, *, /) within `calc()`:

```css
.element {
  margin: calc(10px + 2em);
}
```

**3. Nested `calc()`:**
If you must nest `calc()` make sure you are using consistent units. It is best to avoid this if possible.
